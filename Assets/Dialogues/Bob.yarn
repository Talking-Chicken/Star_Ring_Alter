Bob: The first two lines are to see how Yarn Spinner handles text in different lines.
Bob: for example: this is a new line.

Bob: above, I skipped a line. And now, let's see how buttons can vary between different amount of texts.
-> that's a test for a huge amount of nonsense text that is going to be inserted in a button. Let's see whether Yarn Spinner can overflow the button or make it wider? 
-> also, we should see how buttons under them behave, will they maintain a fixed ratio of gap, or the texts stack together? do we need to code to make the speaking bubble wider? And how about it's super super super long.
